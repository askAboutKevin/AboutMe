         <h4>Education</h4>
         <p>I am currently in my  final year of undergrad at CUNY John Jay
            College of Criminal justice  studying Computer Science and Information Security  with a minor in Security Management
         </p>
         <h4>Hobbies</h4>
         <p>I enjoy going to the  gym, playing basketball and
            football with friends and reading  science-fiction and fantasy books.
         </p>
         <h4>Goals</h4>
         <p>My goal is to become  a pro at building useful software that can make a  difference in the lives of
            people around  the world
         </p>
         <h3  id="projects">Projects</h3>
         <h4>
         Cash  Register</h2> 
         <p>For this  project I wanted  to create a  system that would  produce the  same functionality as  a cash
            register in a supermarket. During the process of  creating the project I added more features so that it could function as a RESTful  API. Using the Dropwizard framework, MySQL database, JDBI3
            library, HTML, CSS and JavaScript I  was able to create an API that could accept HTTP requests  and interact with a local database to create, read, update and  delete data so that users could
            complete orders from the the web interface. 
      </div>
      <h4>
      Tortoise and Hare</h2> 
      <p>One of my  first coding assignments at school. Using C++ and object-oriented programming techniques I was able
         to create a program that could simulate a race between a Tortoise and Hare character  based on the well-known folktale.
